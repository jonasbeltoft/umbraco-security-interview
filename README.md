# Umbraco Security System Requirements

Demo app and write up for Umbraco Security Engineering position

## Security issues in free trial

Pass, I can't find anything in the public commercial software, as I'm not a pen tester (yet).

## Application writeup

This web application allows users to select and prioritize languages to display the website in their preferred language. It supports multilingual text and settings synchronized across browser tabs but isolated across different sessions.

### Features

1. **Language Selection and Ordering**:

   - Users can select languages and reorder them by dragging and dropping.
   - Users can change locale specific versions of the language by using a dropdown on each language.
   - The top-selected language determines the display language of the website.
   - Changes are saved in the browserâ€™s local storage to persist across sessions.

2. **Add Language Modal**:

   - A modal window allows users to search for and add new languages.
   - It includes real-time, case-insensitive search and multiple selection (checkboxes).

3. **Dynamic Text and UI Updates**:

   - Text elements such as descriptions and buttons are translated into the top-selected language.
   - Translations are fetched from the `/translations/<language code>` endpoint and stored in local storage.
   - The application fetches available languages from the `/allLanguages/<language code>` endpoint.
   - The site main and specific languages text is updated in real-time when the user changes the selected language or it's locale.

4. **Local Storage Usage**:

   - Language preferences and translations are stored in local storage as `deviceSettings` and `translations`.
   - The `deviceSettings` key contains an array of selected language codes, dictating the order of languages.
   - The `translations` key contains localized text for various UI elements.

5. **Cross-Tab Synchronization**:

   - The application uses a `StorageEvent` listener to detect changes in local storage and update all open tabs accordingly.

6. **Backend Endpoints**:

   - **GET `/allLanguages/<language code>`**: Returns a list of all languages translated into the specified language.
   - **GET `/translations/<language code>`**: Returns the site text translations for the specified language.
   - The `<language code>` is an ISO language code such as **da**.

### Backend Storage

- **Data Storage**:

  - Data could be stored in a NoSQL database like MongoDB for efficiency and flexibility.
  - Language data and translations can be organized by language code to optimize read performance and support easy additions of new languages.

- **Proposed Schemas**:
  - **Languages Schema**: Each document represents a language with its corresponding translations and locales.
  - **Translations Schema**: Stores UI text in different languages to support localization.

### Potential Improvements

- Consider using a relational database for structured data and complex queries.
- Implement caching strategies to minimize database reads and enhance performance.
